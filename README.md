## Deductions
I have reviewed the list of deductions for this project and in the syllabus.

## Comments
Created a different JavaScript file for each branch. Listener branch uses main.js; the form branch uses form.js; and the custom branch uses custom.js. Sometimes I can code easily and other times it takes hours and hours to do one thing!
